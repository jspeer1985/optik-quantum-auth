Optik Quantum Authentication Protocol (OQAP)
draft-jspeer-optik-auth-protocol-00

Abstract
This document describes the Optik Quantum Authentication Protocol (OQAP), a cryptographically enforced, biometric and AI-driven user authentication framework. The protocol integrates decentralized identity verification using blockchain wallets, multi-modal biometric factors, real-time behavioral scoring via GPT models, and NFT-based access gating. Designed for zero-trust architectures, it ensures high-assurance digital identity resolution in enterprise and consumer-facing platforms.

Status of This Memo
This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

Introduction

Optik Quantum Authentication Protocol (OQAP) is a universal identity framework that supports:

Wallet-based cryptographic keys (e.g., Solana, Ethereum)

Biometric inputs (face, fingerprint, iris, voice, tone, gesture)

GPT behavioral verification (via audit endpoint)

NFT license gating for enterprise compliance

The purpose is to replace passwords and legacy 2FA with real-time, programmable trust models that support SOC2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 compliance.

Protocol Overview

Authentication Steps:

Initiate challenge request from secure endpoint.

Client presents wallet and biometric factors.

Server verifies biometric + wallet signature.

GPT endpoint scores risk via behavior + context.

Access granted if biometric, behavioral, and NFT license valid.

NFT License System

The access control mechanism uses a licensed NFT issued via Solana's SPL token standard. Access to Optik GPT verification endpoints is gated by ownership of the NFT.

NFT metadata includes:

Issuer: Optik Technologies

License terms: Non-transferable enterprise compliance key

Smart contract enforcement: Metadata-bound validation lock

Audit integration: Verifiable access logs on-chain

Auto-minting instructions:

Deploy metadata JSON to Arweave/IPFS

Use Metaplex CLI to mint NFT to target address

Validate license by checking NFT ownership + metadata hash

Security Considerations

All biometric data processed locally or in zk enclave

Wallet signing ensures cryptographic non-repudiation

GPT scores anomalies in tone, emotion, gesture

Audit logs recorded on-chain

Deployment Guidance

SDK available at: https://github.com/jspeer1985/optik-quantum-auth

Installation:

npm install @optik/auth-sdk

Interoperability

Supports:

Solana Wallet Adapter

React + Node.js / Next.js environments

Compatible with Metaplex NFT licenses

IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA considerations at this time.
